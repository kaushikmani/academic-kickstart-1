Project Summary:

- Explored the multimodal neural approach in image captioning using MSCOCO dataset.
- Implemented multiple encoder- decoder architectures like traditional the CNN-LSTM model and CNN-LSTM model with attention network.
- Improved overall performance of the model using transfer learning approaches in both the encoder and decoder.

Frameworks:

Pytorch, Numpy, Matplotlib.
