Project Summary:

- Extended the knowledge graph completion model TransE, by incorporating the natural language aspect of the
knowledge graph, something that is ignored by most KG completion models.
- Proposed 3 different models to evaluate our approach using the FB15k dataset.
- Solved the Out Of Vocabulary(OOV) problem of the KG completion models.
- Showed 50% improvement from results on TransE models on hits on a smaller subset of the dataset.

Frameworks:

Pytorch, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
