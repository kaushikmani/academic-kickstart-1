Project Summary:

- Explored various supervised deep learning architectures like CNN, RNN to create a frontend component for an Automatic Speech Recognizer system such as Siri or Alexa that enhances the quality of noisy signal before it can be used for speech recognition.
- Recurrent Neural Networks like RNN and LSTM are better equipped to handle sequential data, and hence our models showed considerable improvement over the baseline DNN models.

Frameworks:

Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
