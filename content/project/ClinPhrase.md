Project Summary:

- Proposed a new framework named ClinPhrase to effectively and efficiently extract quality and meaningful phrases from clinical documents with only a limited amount of training data
- Used a combination of simple data-driven statistics and deep neural network based features to extract a set of quality phrases
- Compared with existing clinical phrase extraction tools, our method is up to 82 times faster while extracting 4 times more phrases on the MIMIC-III dataset.

Frameworks:

Pytorch.
